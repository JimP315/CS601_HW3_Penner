BU Masters of Software Development
In module 3 after having a couple of weeks solely on HTML and CSS we began on JavaScript
## We built an alert to get client to enter a name, and it needed to have at least 2 characters in the string.  Then we had a do while loop to loop to loop through and ensure that the user added
two numbers into the system, so that we can perform simple addition on it. 
# I added some simple styling with a click button, and an event listener function to facilitate the process.
